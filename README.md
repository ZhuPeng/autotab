# Smart Tab Manager

## Project Overview

Smart Tab Manager is a Chrome extension designed to automatically manage browser tabs.

The extension provides a user-friendly settings interface that allows users to customize the maximum number of tabs, tab timeout duration, and check interval.

## Features

- **Tab management**: Users can view recently closed tabs and choose to restore them.
